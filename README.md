# automatic-train
## What is this?

This is a public repo that I started to hold all the various small scripts and automations that I write as a entry-level IT tech (the ones worth saving at least). 

Currently, it only contains a sanitized version AutoHotKey script that I run on my computer to automate basic repetive tasks, I plan to heavily rewrite this script so that it's easier to share and I don't have to worry about only uploading sanitized versions to the repo. It will eventualy include other things as I write them, most likely Powershell and Python automation scripts.
