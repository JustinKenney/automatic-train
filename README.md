# automatic-train
## What is this?

This is a public repo that I started to hold all the various small scripts and automations that I write as a entry-level IT tech (the ones worth saving at least). 

Currently, it contains my daily driver AutoHotKey script as well as a few PowerShell scripts I have started working on.

Always looking for feeback!
